# US-Crime

The full database of UCR crime data is too large to include in this repository or as a download comprising many tables that are linked together by primary and foreign key constraints. Instead, this project includes a small excerpt of the database that mainly comprises only data for Rhode Island in 2017. This slice means that API endpoints will return some data and that we can run our tests, but you will have to load the full database to see more data.
